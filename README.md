PacMetro is a game to improve the understanding of a city's metro system by letting pacman run over the metro system.
Pacman can be controlled by the 'space' key of the keyboard. By the key 'L' pacman is changing the line or the direction of its current line.

The game has two modes:

I) Geographic Mode - Enter a location of this city and run with pacman to the nearest station.

II) Schematic Mode - Run with pacman from station to station and eat all the pizzas. Do not get caught by the ghosts.
